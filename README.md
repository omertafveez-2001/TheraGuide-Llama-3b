# TheraGuide - Llama-3B Instruction Tuned Therapy ChatBot
![screenshot](assets/chatbotui.jpg)

## Introduction
Introducing a Multi-Stage Chat Instruct Model as a Therapy Assistant right at your browser. <br> The model is capable of generating responses closest to your therapist. It is built on `DistilBert` and `Llama-3B` and deployed on `HuggingFace Spaces`.  <br>

The chatbot implementation is reproduced using the LIMA approach [Less is more Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11206). The training process of DistilBert and Llama-3B curates specific and complex structures of prompts and queries. <br>

The experimentation was to produce an instruction-tuned chatbot curated from a complex conversational tool, "Therapy," which produced strong results, complying with the paper's findings:
`The reasoning, natural language understanding and most of the knowledge of the Large Language Model is learned during the pretraining process and only a finite number of instruction-paired samples are needed to fine-tune it on downstream tasks.`
